# Minecraft commands

You can execute commands to Minecraft by typing `/`. This isn't part of Forge,
but can be useful for switching back and forth between creative and survival.


For example, this sequence commands will 

1. Switch to survival mode 
2. Create a hunger effect for 3 seconds, at amplication level 100
3. Switch to creative mode

```
/gamemode s
/effect <TAB> minecraft:hunger 3 100
/gamemode c
```

Note that Minecraft supports tab completion. For example,  you can type `m<TAB>hu` to 
autocomplete to `minecraft:hunger`.

See [Commands] for more details.
