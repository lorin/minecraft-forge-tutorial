# Introduction

This is a simple up and running guide for building Minecraft mods with
Minecraft Forge. I wrote it as a personal learning aid.

This book covers Forge 1.12.

Writing mods with Forge requires knowledge of Java. This book assumes you're
already familiar with Java.

It's also written from the perspective of:

* Running on macOS
* IntelliJ IDEA as your IDE
