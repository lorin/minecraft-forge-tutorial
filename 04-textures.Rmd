# Custom texture

An item texture is a 16x16 PNG file.

## Looking at existing textures

You can examine the existing textures that ship with Minecraft. They're in the
`~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/versions/x.x.x/x.x.x.jar`.

For example, if you have 1.12.2 installed, to get a list of all of the textures:

```bash
unzip -l ~/Library/Application\ Support/minecraft/versions/1.12.2/1.12.2.jar | grep png | less
```
